# Readme
Within the past two decades, broadband access has rapidly expanded to include over 300 million users within the United States, meaning now more than ever, digital technologies are changing the way we seek and share information. From meal-prep recipes to YouTube tutorials on changing car tires, the Internet is a diverse network of information resources, especially in disseminating news and political information. Researchers have paid close attention to this phenomenon, exploring the potential for political information to spark mobilization. The resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement at the height of the pandemic is one such example of how social media inspired action amongst the public by amplifying the stories of Ahmed Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd.

This brings us to our research questions, in which we aim to explore the relationship between broadband access and voter turnout. Our data analysis is guided by the following questions:
How are changes in US broadband access reflected in changes in US voter turnout results over the years?
How do the top five and bottom five broadband access states compare in terms of voter turnout?
What regional patterns do we find across broadband access and voter turnout?
Is there a similar correlation between broadband access and voter turnout in Washington counties?

By answering these questions, we hope to identify how the digital divide intersects with political participation. The results of our analysis will be important to broadband service providers and policymakers as they consider the importance of broadband access to maintaining democracy.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
